## 0. Ask Mohammed to be onboarded to LLNL. 

You will receive an email from Barry Chen (most likely) and will need to provide your address for them to ship you an RSA token. 

## 0.5. Check your mail for a physical RSA token. 

Meet with Barry following mail receipt of the RSA token. 

## 1. ssh onto an LLNL compute cluster, accessing a compute node like [Dane](https://hpc.llnl.gov/hardware/compute-platforms/dane):
```
dhcp-10-118-155-112:~ mayavenkatraman$ ssh venkatraman2@dane.llnl.gov
```
You will be prompted for your 8-digit pin appended to the 6-digit number on the RSA token you received in the mail.  

## 2. ssh onto Tuolomne, which has the same architecture as exascale supercomputer El Capit√°n.
```
[venkatraman2@dane6:~]$ ssh tuolumne.llnl.gov
```
